## 🎓 Best Practices Summary

**Golden Rules:**
1. **Measure first** - Use React DevTools Profiler, Chrome DevTools
2. **Biggest impact first** - Waterfalls → Bundle → Server → Micro
3. **Don't over-optimize** - Focus on real bottlenecks
4. **Use platform features** - Next.js has optimizations built-in
5. **Think about users** - Real-world conditions matter

**Performance Mindset:**
- Every `await` in sequence = potential waterfall
- Every `import` = potential bundle bloat
- Every re-render = wasted computation (if unnecessary)
- Server components = less JavaScript to ship
- Measure, don't guess
