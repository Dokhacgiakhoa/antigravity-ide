# How It Works

Headers are automatically applied when using `helpers.createContext()`:

```javascript
const context = await helpers.createContext(browser);
const page = await context.newPage();
// All requests from this page include your custom headers
```

For scripts using raw Playwright API, use the injected `getContextOptionsWithHeaders()`:

```javascript
const context = await browser.newContext(
  getContextOptionsWithHeaders({ viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 } }),
);
```

## Tips

- **CRITICAL: Detect servers FIRST** - Always run `detectDevServers()` before writing test code for localhost testing
- **Custom headers** - Use `PW_HEADER_NAME`/`PW_HEADER_VALUE` env vars to identify automated traffic to your backend
- **Use /tmp for test files** - Write to `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js`, never to skill directory or user's project
- **Parameterize URLs** - Put detected/provided URL in a `TARGET_URL` constant at the top of every script
- **DEFAULT: Visible browser** - Always use `headless: false` unless user explicitly asks for headless mode
- **Headless mode** - Only use `headless: true` when user specifically requests "headless" or "background" execution
- **Slow down:** Use `slowMo: 100` to make actions visible and easier to follow
- **Wait strategies:** Use `waitForURL`, `waitForSelector`, `waitForLoadState` instead of fixed timeouts
- **Error handling:** Always use try-catch for robust automation
- **Console output:** Use `console.log()` to track progress and show what's happening

## Troubleshooting

**Playwright not installed:**

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR && npm run setup
```

**Module not found:**
Ensure running from skill directory via `run.js` wrapper

**Browser doesn't open:**
Check `headless: false` and ensure display available

**Element not found:**
Add wait: `await page.waitForSelector('.element', { timeout: 10000 })`

## Example Usage

```
User: "Test if the marketing page looks good"

Claude: I'll test the marketing page across multiple viewports. Let me first detect running servers...
[Runs: detectDevServers()]
[Output: Found server on port 3001]
I found your dev server running on http://localhost:3001

[Writes custom automation script to /tmp/playwright-test-marketing.js with URL parameterized]
[Runs: cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-marketing.js]
[Shows results with screenshots from /tmp/]
```

```
User: "Check if login redirects correctly"

Claude: I'll test the login flow. First, let me check for running servers...
[Runs: detectDevServers()]
[Output: Found servers on ports 3000 and 3001]
I found 2 dev servers. Which one should I test?
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:3001

User: "Use 3001"

[Writes login automation to /tmp/playwright-test-login.js]
[Runs: cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-login.js]
[Reports: ✅ Login successful, redirected to /dashboard]
```

## Notes

- Each automation is custom-written for your specific request
- Not limited to pre-built scripts - any browser task possible
- Auto-detects running dev servers to eliminate hardcoded URLs
- Test scripts written to `/tmp` for automatic cleanup (no clutter)
- Code executes reliably with proper module resolution via `run.js`
- Progressive disclosure - API_REFERENCE.md loaded only when advanced features needed
